The sound of my breath overpowered the beat of my heart as I sprinted, full of adrenaline, away from the black suited men. The sound of heavy footsteps, shouting voices, and cars cut sharply through my thoughts as I tried to plan a way to get out of this nightmare. 

As my legs were about to collapse with overexertion, the sight of deep, thick bushes injected my body with adrenaline. The tickling of sweat ran down my face as I finally sat down to rest, deep in the cover of the bushes. 
Everything went quiet as soon as I began to slow down my breath...

As I got prepared to run again, I felt a branch give way under my foot. 
The sound was soft, but sounded like thunder in the silence and in my sensitive, paranoid ears. 
Shocked with fear, I felt even the tiniest touch as electricity ran throughout my body, making my heart stop in mid-beat. I stood there for what seemed like an eternity before I began to breathe normally again. As I began to head towards the deeper part of the bushes, I saw the outline of one of the masked black suited men; his gun and eyes pointed at my head.

The dark silhouette was the last thing I saw before I felt a piercing pain rip through my skull; the final images of the world slowly fading away.
