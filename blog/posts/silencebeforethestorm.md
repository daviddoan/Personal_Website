It was the perfect Sunday; blue, without a single cloud in the sky. The sun shinning directly overhead, showing its beauty, sharing its light and warmth with everybody below. The sound of children and clanging of church bells was heard in the distance while I was relaxing under a large fig tree, watching the beautiful battleships deport from the harbor, departing the water like a graceful whale. It was peaceful, here, sitting under this tree, watching and listen to the environment around me. It was peaceful until the silence.

Suddenly, there was no sound. It was as if a bubble was placed around me, separating me from everything else. No birds chirping, no seagulls gawking overhead; only the distant sound of the children playing. It was disturbing, having no natural sounds. I didn't understand what had just occurred until they came...

The ground suddenly shook, making the figs rain from the tree above me, followed by a tremendous explosion that had my ear drums throbbing with excruciating pain. Close, loud rumbling of machine gun shells hitting the floor filled the air. It wasn't until I stood up that I saw what was happening...

Close V formation Japanese airplanes approached and dive-bombed the beautiful US battleships, blasting material, debris, and dead personnel into the air.

The Japanese plane immediately, after destroying the ships, went for the base that was headed in my direction. I began to run, without a single thought that I was going to make it alive to the nearest shelter. The motor of the airplane began to come nearer and nearer, throwing ground and rocks into the air like a of leaf blower. The sound of the machine gun echoed into my blood-pumped ears while the ground around me was being blasted into bits. Whizzing bullets flew overhead, giving me an immense adrenaline rush which boosted my speed. 
The shadow of the airplane slowly crept up my body; surrounding me, suffocating my strength and hope. As I turned my head to face my destiny, I saw the gleeful face of the Japanese pilot and we both knew that I would die. As I mentally gave up, I felt death brush my face....

The sudden explosion hit me fully in the chest and my body flew into the air, landing painfully face first into the pavement of the base. I slowly got up from the painful blow. As I looked up to see what happened, I saw that the plane was completely obliterated.

The Japanese plane was on fire, releasing a trail of thick, black smoke as its nose was plunged head first into the ground; its wings plummeted with bullet holes. I scanned the base for the origin of my savior until I spotted a young, black man arming himself at the Flak gun, the barrels still smoking. The young man saw me staring and gave me a curt nod as he understood that he had just saved my life.

As I looked back towards the beautiful ocean, I saw that its beauty was tainted with fresh blood and death as bodies of young men floated on the surface...

The war had begun.
